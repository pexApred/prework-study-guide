          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users and is contained in the head.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, i.e. what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the property and value for that property.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together with a comma.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the HTML, enabling us to choose freely which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
