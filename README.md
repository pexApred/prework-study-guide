# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Transitioning into a new career began with enrolling into a coding bootcamp. Learning the workflow of a software engineer and the basics of building a webpage, there is a lot of information to keep organized. This prework has provided a project to stay organized through building an interactive webpage that can be used throughout the span of the bootcamp as a reference. The pre-work has taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've learned how to use a terminal to code and using the Git flow I was able to build the webpage successfully.

The webpage organizes information learned throughout the prework into sections. Each topic section, like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript contains summarized notes. If DevTools console is opened, we can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned and will choose one topic for us to study first.
